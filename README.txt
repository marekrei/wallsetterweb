WallSetter is an Android app which updates your wallpaper, based on a request from a server. 
This is the server part, written in PHP. There is another project called WallSetter which is the actual app.
See www.siineiolekala.net/wallsetter for more information.

For installation rename inc/config_example.php into inc/config.php and update the contents. 

The app is free and open source. It is mostly meant for learning but you can use it any way you want.
However, it also comes with no guarantees or warranty regarding potential problems. You install, use 
and modify the app and the code entirely at your own responsibility.
If you do use the code, I'd appreciate a reference to me and the webpage.
